This Python script demonstrates how to create and transfer an Algorand Standard Asset (ASA) using AlgoKit Utils. It works on a LocalNet setup and walks through the following steps:

Initializes a local Algorand client.

Creates two accounts: sender and receiver.

Funds both accounts using the LocalNet dispenser.

Creates an ASA (MyToken with 2 decimal places).

Opts in the receiver account to the ASA.

Transfers 100 tokens from sender to receiver.

Verifies and prints the receiverâ€™s ASA balance.

This is ideal for testing ASA workflows and understanding basic token operations on Algorand. Make sure you have a LocalNet running and algokit-utils installed before executing.
