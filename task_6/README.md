RemintContract – Asset Re-Minting via ARC-4
This smart contract demonstrates asset metadata management and controlled re-minting of Algorand Standard Assets (ASA) using Algorand's ARC-4 ABI specification and algopy.

Features
Structured Metadata: Uses AssetMetadata struct to store ASA parameters like total supply, unit name, metadata hash, and role addresses.

Asset Creation: Creator can store metadata for an ASA, simulating creation.

Re-Minting Logic:

Each user (identified by a user_id) is allowed to re-mint an ASA only once.

A new ASA ID is generated and mapped to the user.

Use Case
Ideal for issuing duplicate or updated assets to users while preventing abuse, such as for certificates, licenses, or proof-of-ownership tokens.

Note: create_asset() and remint() use placeholder logic for ASA ID generation—requires actual itxn.AssetConfig() integration for mainnet/testnet use.
